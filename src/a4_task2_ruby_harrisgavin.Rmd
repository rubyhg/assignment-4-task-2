### 1. Introduction

This report provides an exploratory overview of weight differences in male and female juvenile hares across three sites of the Bonanza Creek Long-term Ecological Research (LTER), as well as the relationship between weight and hindfoot length in juvenile hares. Data was collected from 1999-2012 at sites Bonanza Black Spruce, Bonanza Mature, and Bonanza Riparian (Kielland et al. 2017).

### 2. Data & Analyses

Data on Snowshoe hare measurements were collected and made available by Dr. Knut Kielland and colleagues at the Bonanza Creek Long-term Ecological Research (LTER), which is 20km southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska. The data contain observations of individual Snowshoe hares that were trapped between 1999 and 2012, but the research continues today. 

Following exploratory data visualization, the weights of juvenile males and females are shown by two-sample t-tests using a significance level ($\alpha$) of 0.05 throughout. Differences between groups are described by Cohen's *d* effect size. The relationship between weight and hindfoot length is explored by simple linear regression. All analyses are in R version 4.0.2 using RStudio version 1.3.1056.


### 3. Exploratory Findings


#### I. Annual Juvenile Hare Trap Counts

```{r}
# Reading in the data and cleaning it up so that it contains just juveniles and has a column for year. Plus, I am cleaning up data names so that I can use them easily later.
hare_data <- read_csv(here("data","bonanza_hares.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(date = mdy(date)) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>% 
  filter(age == "j") %>% 
  mutate(site_full = case_when(
    grid %in% c("bonrip") ~ "Bonanza Riparian",
    grid %in% c("bonmat") ~ "Bonanza Mature",
    grid %in% c("bonbs") ~ "Bonanza Black Spruce")) %>% 
  mutate(sex = case_when(
    sex %in% c("m") ~ "Male",
    sex %in% c("f") ~ "Female"))

# Making a new set of data that just includes juvenile hare counts.
count_data <- hare_data %>% 
  count(age, year)

# Making the finalized visualization of what the count_data looks likes. 
ggplot(data = count_data, aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Bonanza Creek LTER Annual Juvenile Hare Trap Counts: 1999-2012", x = "Year", y = "Juvenile Hares") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1999,2000,2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,25,50,75,100,125,150)) +
  theme_classic()

```

**Figure 2.** Total number of juvenile hares trapped each year at Bonanza Creek LTER sites from 1999-2012. Data: Kielland et al. 2017.

Since trapping began in 1999, the number of juveniles trapped appears to have steadily decreased. The maximum count is in the first trapping year (1999) with a total of 126 juvenile hares trapped. However, there is great fluctuation in the number of juveniles caught throughout the 14 year span of this dataset, with some years (2002, 2009) resulting in 0 juveniles trapped. Perhaps in 1999 when the study began, there was a significant effort to trap hares which resulted in this large total count. Because of this, it is possible that 1999 had an unusually high count, and in fact the number of juveniles caught has remained steady after that unusual peak. 


#### II. Visualization of Juvenile Hare Weights

```{r}
# Using ggplot beeswarm to visualize this data
ggplot(data = hare_data, aes(x = sex, y = weight)) +
  geom_beeswarm(aes(color = sex)) +
  facet_wrap(~site_full) + #facet_wrap to compare weights across sites
  scale_color_manual(values = c("goldenrod2","cyan4"), na.value = "coral") +
  geom_boxplot(fill = NA, width = .25, outlier.color = NA) +
  stat_summary(fun=mean, 
               geom="point", 
               shape=20, 
               size=4, 
               color="black", 
               fill="black") + #This boxplot and stat_summary allowed me to represent the mean weights
  theme_classic() +
  labs(y = "Weight (grams)",
       x = "Sex",
       title = "Sex vs. Weight: Juvenile Hares")
```

**Figure 3.** Comparison of male and female juvenile hare weight at sites Bonanza Black Spruce, Bonanza Mature, and Bonanza Riparian. Box endpoints indicate the 25^th^ and 75^th^ percentile values; the black line and black point within the box indicate the median and mean value for each sex, respectively. Data: Kielland et al. 2017.


On average, it appears male juvenile hares weigh more than female juvenile hares at all three sites. It is interesting to note that both the males and the females at the Bonanza Black Spruce site on average weigh more than the hares at either Bonanza Mature or Bonanza Riparian. However, the hares at Bonanza Riparian have the largest distribution of weights, including the highest values at over 1600g. One explanation for this could be the differences in resource availability at each site, or the number of predators that live near these sites.


#### III. Juvenile Male and Female Snowshoe Hare Weight: Descriptive Statistics

```{r descriptive_stats}
# Getting the summary stat values that I will include in the table.
hare_table <- hare_data %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean = round(mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),2),
    sd = round(sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE),2),
    n = n()
  )

```



**Table 1.** Summary statistics for juvenile male and female Snowshoe hare weight. Data: Kielland et al. 2017.
```{r}
# Using kableExtra to create my table
hare_table %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Sex", "Mean weight (g)", "Standard deviation (g)", "Sample size")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
```


```{r, include = FALSE}
# In this code chunk I am checking assumptions and making exploratory graphs.

# Pulling vectors of weights for male and female hares

# male weights
male_weight <- hare_data %>% 
  filter(sex == "Male") %>% 
  select(sex,weight) %>% 
  pull(weight)

# female weights
female_weight <- hare_data %>% 
  filter(sex == "Female") %>% 
  select(sex,weight) %>% 
  pull(weight)

# Plot histograms & qq-plots to check assumptions
hist(male_weight) # Looks normal
qqnorm(male_weight) # Relatively linear
hist(female_weight) # Maybe a bit negatively skewed
qqnorm(female_weight) # Looks very linear

# Overall: this data looks normal!


# Using a t-test to see it there is a significant difference between male and female weight.
hare_ttest <- t.test(male_weight, female_weight)
hare_ttest

# Tidy model results to call outputs in-line: 
hare_ttest_tidy <- tidy(hare_ttest)

# p-value is very low, so I would reject the null. It is likely these values came from populations with two different means.

# Get the means & SDs for each: 
male_mean <- mean(male_weight, na.rm = TRUE)
female_mean <- mean(female_weight, na.rm = TRUE)
male_sd <- sd(male_weight, na.rm = TRUE)
female_sd <- sd(female_weight, na.rm = TRUE)


# Cohen's d test.
hare_effsize <- cohen.d(male_weight, female_weight, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Hare weight (grams) was compared across the two sexes; site was not included as a variable here, but should be investigated moving forward. On average, juvenile male Snowshoe hares (`r hare_table[2,2]` $\pm$ `r hare_table[2,3]`g, *n* = `r hare_table[2,4]`) weighed more than juvenile females 
(`r hare_table[1,2]` $\pm$ `r hare_table[1,3]`g, *n* = `r hare_table[1,4]`).

While the absolute difference in means is `r round(male_mean, 2) - round(female_mean, 2)` g (a `r round((male_mean - female_mean)/((male_mean + female_mean)/2)*100, 2)`% difference), the difference in means is significant (Welch's two-sample t-test: t(`r round(hare_ttest_tidy$parameter,2)`) = `r round(hare_ttest_tidy$statistic,2)`, p < 0.05), and the effect size is moderate (Cohen's *d* = `r round(hare_effsize$estimate,2)`).

#### IV. Relationship between juvenile weight & hindfoot length

An exploratory visualization of the relationship between juvenile weight and hindfoot length was completed. 

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Do linear regression
hare_lm <- lm(weight ~ hindft, data = hare_data)

# Get tidy versions of the model output to call later on in text
hare_lm_tidy <- tidy(hare_lm)
hare_lm_glance <- glance(hare_lm)

# See model diagnostics:
# plot(hare_lm)

# Get Pearson's r correlation
hare_cor <- cor.test(hare_data$weight, hare_data$hindft)

# Tidy version of correlation output:
hare_cor_tidy <- tidy(hare_cor)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = hare_data, aes(y = weight, x = hindft)) +
  geom_point(color = "cyan4") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "Weight (g)",
       x = "Hindfoot Length (mm)",
       title = "Weight vs. Hindfoot Length of Juvenile Hares")
```

**Figure 4.** Relationship between juvenile weight (g) and hindfoot length (mm). Points indicate individual hare measurements. Data: Kielland et al. 2017.

```{r}
ggplot(data = hare_data, aes(y = weight, x = hindft)) +
  geom_point(color = "cyan4") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "gray30") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "Weight (g)",
       x = "Hindfoot Length (mm)",
       title = "Linear Regression: Weight vs. Hindfoot Length")
```

**Figure 5.** Linear regression exploring relationship between juvenile weight (g) and hindfoot length (mm). Linear model summary: $\beta$~1~ = `r round(hare_lm_tidy$estimate[2], 2)` g mm^-1^, p < 0.05, R^2^ = `r round(hare_lm_glance$r.squared,2)`, Pearson's *r* = `r round(hare_cor_tidy$estimate,2)`). Data: Kielland et al. 2017.

The relationship between juvenile hare weight and hindfoot length appears somewhat linear (Figure 5). Linear regression revealed that weight may predict hindfoot lenth (p < 0.05, R^2^ = `r round(hare_lm_glance$r.squared,2)`) with an average slope of $\beta$ = `r round(hare_lm_tidy$estimate[2], 2)` g mm^-1^ (i.e., for each one millimeter increase in hindfoot length we expect an average increase in weight of `r round(hare_lm_tidy$estimate[2], 2)` g). However,  it does not appear that weight and hindfoot length are strongly correlated, though they are positively and significantly correlated (Pearson's *r* = `r round(hare_cor_tidy$estimate,2)`, p < 0.05).  

### Summary

Exploratory analysis of the Kielland et al. 2017 data reveals the following initial findings:

- The number of juveniles caught has been decreasing since a large peak in 1999. 
- On average, male juvenile hares weigh more than female juvenile hares ((`r hare_table[2,2]` $\pm$ `r hare_table[2,3]`g, *n* = `r hare_table[2,4]`) and 
(`r hare_table[1,2]` $\pm$ `r hare_table[1,3]`g, *n* = `r hare_table[1,4]`), respectively).
- Using simple linear regression, there is a positive and significant correlation between juvenile weight and hindfoot length ( $\beta$~1~ = `r round(hare_lm_tidy$estimate[2], 2)` g mm^-1^, p < 0.05, R^2^ = `r round(hare_lm_glance$r.squared,2)`, Pearson's *r* = `r round(hare_cor_tidy$estimate,2)`). However, because there isn't a strong relationship, further analysis of this relationship is recommended. 

Next steps:

- Understanding the factors that influence weight of juvenile hares at each research site (Bonanza Black Spruce, Bonanza Mature, and Bonanza Riparian). 
- Further analyses looking at the relationship between weight and hindfoot length (such as incorporating sex or site)
